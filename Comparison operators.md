*Note: that this is written as 2 separate characters: >= but when you write it in your editor, it will show up as one character (this is called a ligature).*

#### Strictly greater than (>)
#### Greater than or equal (>=)
#### Strictly less than (<)
#### Less than or equal (<=)

### Equality comparison
- ```=``` operator has already been used by JavaScript for assignment. e.g. ```let age = 10```    
- there is a completely different operator used for equality comparison and that is ```===``` thats 3 equals ===        
-> **So 1 equal sign is for assignment and 3 equal signs are for equality comparison.**     
- When you want to check that 2 numbers are NOT the same, then you should use the ```!==```operator.
