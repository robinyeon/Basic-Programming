## Expression
An expression is a combination of one or more variables, functions, and operators that the programming language computes to produce a value.    
e.g.
- ```1+2``` produces ```3```
- ```a+b``` produces the sum of ```a``` and ```b``` (assuming ```a``` and ```b``` are numbers)
- ```year + 10``` produces a number which is the result of adding 10 to the variable ```year```
- ```age === 18``` produces a boolean (either ```true``` or ```false```, depending on the ```age```)
- ```age >= 18``` also produces a boolean depending on the ```age```

## Console log expression
- ```console.log(expression)``` is often mentioned in documentation meaning that console.log expects to receive an expression.
- An expression produces a value and can be written wherever a value is expected.
