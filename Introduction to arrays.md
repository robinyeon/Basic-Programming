```
let grades = [10, 15, 13, 10, 18]
```
To create an array, you start by opening a square bracket ```[```
Then you list the items, seperating them by a comma character ```,```
Finally, after the last element, you need to close the ```]```


```
let grades = [10, 15, 13, 10, 18,]
```
- The syntax is also forgiving because if you accidentally add a comma after the last array item, it would still work.
- ```10```, ```15```, ... , ```18``` are called array items.
