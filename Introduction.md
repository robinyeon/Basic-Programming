## Learning = Making mistakes
Learning programming is a process of making mistakes and learning from them.  
Do not get discouraged when you can't solve a challenge.  

## Variables
A variable is used to store information so that you can use it and manipulate it later on.  
e.g. (in JavaScript) ``` let age = 21 ```

## Anatomy of variable declarations
```let age = 30``` breack this down, there are 4 things happening here: 
- **let** : is a keyword that we use to tell the computer that we want to create a new variable
- age : **name** of the variable
- = : then followed by the equal sign which assins it (or gives it a value)
- 30 : what we chose as the **value** of this variable  

*Later on, you will have several variables in your code and you will need to keep track of them and remember what
each variables is responsible for. This is why you should always give your variables descriptive names and avoid 
using single-letter variables such as ```x```, ```y```.*
