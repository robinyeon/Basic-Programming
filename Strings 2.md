### String  methods

#### Difference between methods and properties.
e.g. ```name.length``` is a property whereas ```name.toUpperCase()``` is a method.  
- Methods require the parantheses at the end or else they won't work.
- ```()``` <- as a way to perform an action.

#### Is it a method or a function?
A method is a function with the differenct that the method is called on something.    
e.g. ```.toUpperCase()``` is a method called on ```string```.     

#### .toUpperCase() & .toLowerCase()
