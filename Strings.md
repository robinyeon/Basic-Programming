### Intro to strings
e.g.  
```let city = Amsterdam```
- the programming language will think that ```Amsterddam``` is a variable. This is why we have to wrap it with double quotes. 
- multi-line strings won't work with double-quotes.

### String length (.length)
- **.length** is a property of a string. In fact, it's the only property on strings.
- The word **property** means that it's like a characteristic of this string that is already computed.
