- Adding an ```else``` to an existing ```if``` condition will handle all the other cases not matched by the ```if``` condition.
- If we have an if condition checking for ```age >= 18```, then the ```else``` will be checking for all the other cases. In this example, ```age < 18```.
- ```else``` can only be used after an ```if``` condition. It cannot be used on its own.

## Common mistakes
- Using ```else``` without an ```if```: You can only have an ```else``` after the closing ```}``` of an ```if``` condition.
- Mixing up curly braces
