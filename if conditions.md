e.g.
```
let grade = 15
if (grade >= 10) {
  console.log("This is a passing grade")
}
```
- the ```if``` keyword which is followed by a condition between parentheses
- the condition which is ```grade >= 10```
- Curly braces ```{}``` containing the piece of the code that should be run conditionally (this is called the **body of the if**)


### Branching
Your code would run top to bottom, line by line.      
With ```if``` conditions, some lines of code may be skipped, depending on the condition.       
****Notice how we branch on the if condition. This means that the code inside the body of the if may or may not be executed depending on the condition of the if.***
