- ```undefined``` is a data type in JavaScript.
- ```undefined``` is the equivalent of nothing or no value in plain English.
- When you define a variable without a value, its value will be ```undefined``` (example: ```let age```).
- ```let age``` and ```let age = undefined``` are the same. They both create a variable ```age``` which has the value of ```undefined```.
```
let age = undefined  // undefined
console.log(age)     // undefined
```
```
let age           // undefined
console.log(age)  // undefined
```
